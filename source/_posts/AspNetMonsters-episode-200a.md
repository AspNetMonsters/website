Over the last decade as Monsters we've been so fortunate to connect with so many great people in the industry. In this 5 part series leading up to episode 200 we reconnect with some of the visionaries, teachers, mentors and community members who have inspired us along the way.

In part 1, we visit with Jon Galloway, currently working on the team that is making the experience of development AWESOME for those who work on Mac.

We chat about the turns and hills that shaped his journey, the excitement and challenge of being someone who builds community, and what's ahead in the years to come.
