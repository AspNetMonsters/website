Ah, at last we get to running ASP.NET Core on a Docker image! In this episode the monsters start up their simple ASP.NET Core application inside of a docker container running on a virtualized Linux environment. Learn what goes into a Docker file and how Docker Machine makes all this possible on Windows.

You can read more about Docker at http://www.docker.com/  where you can also download Docker Machine. If you're feeling super adventerous then you could even run on a Raspberry Pi running Linux by using the image at https://hub.docker.com/r/rootdevelop/rpi-aspnetcore/. Finally the ever interesting Scott Hanselman has a slightly dated post on ASP.NET Core on docker on his blog
