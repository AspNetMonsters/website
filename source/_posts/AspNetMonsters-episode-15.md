<p>Ah, at last we get to running ASP.NET Core on a Docker image! In this episode the monsters start up their simple ASP.NET Core application inside of a docker container running on a virtualized Linux environment. Learn what goes into a Docker file and how Docker Machine makes all this possible on Windows.&nbsp;</p><p>You can read more about Docker at <a href="http://www.docker.com/">http://www.docker.com/&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;where you can also download Docker Machine. If you're feeling super adventerous then you could even run on a Raspberry Pi running Linux by using the image at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/rootdevelop/rpi-aspnetcore/">https://hub.docker.com/r/rootdevelop/rpi-aspnetcore/</a>. Finally the ever interesting Scott Hanselman has a slightly dated post on ASP.NET Core on docker on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PublishingAnASPNET5AppToDockerOnLinuxWithVisualStudio.aspx">his blog</a></p><p>&nbsp;As always if you have questions please do post them below.&nbsp;</p><p>Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/AspNetMonsters">the Monsters on Twitter</a> and check out <a href="http://aspnetmonsters.com">the blog</a> for related posts.</p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:8067f5b3458c41f5bd39a5ca00641374">
