The Razor view engine now supports a concept called &quot;Tag Helpers&quot; that dramatically reduces the &quot;c-sharp-iness&quot; of your view and gives you something that looks a lot more like HTML. Dave, that Monster, contrasts this to the earlier incarnation known as HTML Helpers.</p><p>Tag helpers look a lot like custom HTML attributes and might be familiar to you if you've worked with frameworks like Angular. However, these are rendered on the server and not included in the response to the client.</p><p>Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/AspNetMonsters">the Monsters on Twitter</a> and check out <a href="http://aspnetmonsters.com">the blog</a> for related posts.</p><p>The production code for this video is 1v.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:acfc621e628849d9a631a5a701482e07">
