<p>In this episode, Monster James walks you through the basics of prototyping a new feature in your application without having to do the grunt work of creating all the data you need to light the feature up in your UI.</p><p>GenFu is an open source library (created by the Monsters!) that allows you to save&nbsp;<em>hours</em> of work when you're asked to create lists of data to support a test or prototype. When you build out a user experience it's often better to have data that looks realistic, which is old-hat for GenFu. Need 10,000 rows of data in your DB? Yeah, it can help you do that, too.</p><p>Be sure to check out our follow-up episode when we dive into even more advanced use cases.</p><p>Check out GenFu:</p><ul><li>On <a href="https://github.com/MisterJames/GenFu">GitHub</a></li><li>On <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/GenFu/">NuGet</a></li><li>On a <a href="http://genfu.io/">working try-it-out-for-yourself site</a></li></ul><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:4708f8939a5246e4b558a5e20028cc2d">
