In this episode, Monster James walks you through the basics of prototyping a new feature in your application without having to do the grunt work of creating all the data you need to light the feature up in your UI.

GenFu is an open source library (created by the Monsters!) that allows you to save hours of work when you're asked to create lists of data to support a test or prototype. When you build out a user experience it's often better to have data that looks realistic, which is old-hat for GenFu. Need 10,000 rows of data in your DB? Yeah, it can help you do that, too.

Be sure to check out our follow-up episode when we dive into even more advanced use cases.
