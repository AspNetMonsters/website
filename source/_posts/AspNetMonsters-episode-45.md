<p>If you have complex object graphs that you'd like to use in your prototype or test data, chances are you have a swamp load of muck to write to wire those objects up, especially if you want your data to look realistic.</p><p>In this episode of the ASP.NET Monsters, James walks us through creating sample data in more complicated scenarios where properties need special weighting of random distributions, where setter methods need to be invoked, or where you need to compose properties and object graphs. &nbsp;All of this is done with the GenFu library.</p><p>See our intro to <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-22-Realistic-Prototype-Data-in-ASPNET-Core-with-GenFu" target="_blank">GenFu here</a>.</p><p>GenFu is an opensource project created and curated by the Monsters <a href="https://github.com/MisterJames/GenFu/" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p><p>You can try GenFu out live on our <a href="http://genfu.io" target="_blank">sample site</a>.</p><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p>
