<p>With <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> Core we have new options for the way we build out our controllers. Sure, the conventions we know are there, but today we have the option to use as much or as little of the base class as we like in MVC Core.</p><p>Dive in with Simon, Dave and James as they explore the ins-and-outs of using MVC controllers based on the built-in framework, or by using &quot;plain old CLR objects&quot; in your project. Simon builds out some sample controllers and talks about concerns like dependency injection and use of framework features when you use POCOs.</p><p>Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/AspNetMonsters">the Monsters on Twitter</a> and check out <a href="http://aspnetmonsters.com">the blog</a> for related posts.</p><p>The production code for this video is IG.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:cadebbf43ed94e308bb1a5b500ef8408">
