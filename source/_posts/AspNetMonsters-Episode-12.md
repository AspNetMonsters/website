If you've managed to avoid the use of dependency injection so far, your run has come to an end. You can think of DI as a first-class citizen - in fact, it's part of the framework now - but a citizen that is very lightweight and politely gets out of the way if you need something more heavy duty (...and yes! We'll cover that in greater detail in a future episode).
