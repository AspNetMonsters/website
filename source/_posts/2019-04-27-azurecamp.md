If you're reading this I'm hoping you're in the room for Azure Camp 2019 because otherwise there isn't much point. This article is just a bunch of resources for you.

We have a code of conduct here https://confcodeofconduct.com/

# Code
We're going to use a couple of small sample projects during the day. They are on github at 
* https://github.com/stimms/ClassStatus
* https://github.com/stimms/ClassStatusUpdater

# Slides

There are some slides, some of them have secret commands in them. They are up on one drive here: https://1drv.ms/f/s!AmN_cJhXT0rP1yd-qMdkgcHgvKD0

# Class Status

This serves a double purpose. It lets you update your status and it is the demo we're building today. http://classstatus.aspnetmonsters.com/
