<p>In this bonus episode we update everybody on the new expanded prize packages for the Summer of Config contest. We already have some amazing entries using things like Twitter or GPS to configure applications. Still plenty of time to get your entry in. I haven't seen anybody configuring their application based on a lava lamp or on the position of Jupiter in the night sky. With the expanded prizes you'd be crazy not to enter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Summer-of-Config">contest announcement video&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;or read the <a href="http://aspnetmonsters.com/2016/07/summerofconfig/">blog post</a>&nbsp;or watch the <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/ASPNET-Monsters-Episode-50-Configuration-From-Any-Source-in-ASPNET-Core">video that started it all</a></p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:124541422462485593e6a65c0021440a">
