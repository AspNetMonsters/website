<p>In this episode, Dave takes us through caching Razor output using the ASP.NET Core MVC Cache Tag Helper. We look at the different ways you can think about how to break down a page and how it can relate to optimizing your site's performance.</p><p>While not everyone will need the benefit of output caching, any site with multiple web servers running, all accessing the same backend services should likely consider the merits. While other layers and services may provide their own approaches to minimizing resource-intensive lookups, this is just one other tool in the belt to help keep your site snappy.</p><p>&nbsp;<a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:78f1337c1a8440649a84a5df00394c40">
