<p>So you're planning on sending your app out into the wild. Have you thought about what is going to happen when things go sideways? How will you recover when the excrement hits the oscillating device? Without having a reliable way to track down what went wrong, you'll be in the weeds for sure, but logging will help set things right.</p><p>In a departure from previous iterations in MVC, the default template is set up and ready to go for logging. Your project will give you fairly detailed information out of the box at a framework level, and all you need is a few small tweaks (and to lean on DI a little bit) to get logging going in your controllers.</p><p>Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/AspNetMonsters">the Monsters on Twitter</a> and check out <a href="http://aspnetmonsters.com">the blog</a> for related posts.</p><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:f7d7e0a5757b4828be61a5cc00332f25">
