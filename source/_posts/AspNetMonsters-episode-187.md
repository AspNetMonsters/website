In this episode we're pleased to have Kayla Cinnamon (https://twitter.com/cinnamon_msft), PM of the Windows Terminal Team on chatting about the multi-shell terminal management tool from Microsoft. It slides easily into your development tool chain and makes it easy to customize your experience for not only which shell you're using, but also the behaviours and look-and-feel of the shell.

Install the tooling:
 choco install powershell-core
 choco install gh
 choco install poshgit
 choco install microsoft-windows-terminal
