In this episode we're going to have another look at code snippets, but this time in Visual Studio 2019.

Snippets are a great way to tackle repetitive coding tasks, and you can use them creatively to implement large blocks of code quickly, removing friction from the process of building out features.

You can visit the Microsoft Docs site to navigate some of the template functions and the schema reference here: https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/ide/walkthrough-creating-a-code-snippet?view=vs-2019
