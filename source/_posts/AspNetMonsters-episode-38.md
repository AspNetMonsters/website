<p>One of the best things about .NET Core is that it is portable to other platform not just for deployment but for development. If you're running on Linux or OSX then you won't have access to the full version of Visual Studio. That might be good or it might be bad depending on your point of view. There are tools in place, however, to help you out if you don't use Visual Studio. One of these tools is Yeoman.&nbsp;</p><p>Yeoman is a templating tool which allows you to generate whole projects or just individual files from templates. Similar to the way you right click add and select a template in visual studio Yeoman is cross platform and it is great.</p><p>If you're interested in more information about Yeoman check out these links:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="http://yeoman.io/">http://yeoman.io/</a>&nbsp;- Home page for Yeoman</li><li><a href="https://github.com/omnisharp/generator-aspnet">https://github.com/omnisharp/generator-aspnet</a>&nbsp;- Github page for OmniSharp's Yeoman templates</li></ul><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p>
