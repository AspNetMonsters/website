In this episode we walk through several implementation of alerts using the Bootstrap CSS/JS framework and ASP.NET Core MVC. 

From the Bootstrap perspective, we use the simple alert classes and constructs to render the correct HTML for the user.

On the MVC side of things, we explore a few different approaches including changes to our controller, view, template and so forth, then move on to use View Components and a Service that can be injected.
