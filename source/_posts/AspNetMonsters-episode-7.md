Dave walks us through targeting specific tags, elements containing certain attributes or other factors and demonstrates the c# code needed to light up Visual Studio 2015 with intellisense on your own tag helpers in ASP.NET Core.

Dave has also walked through tag helpers extensively on his blog, so be sure to check out his archives (http://www.davepaquette.com/archives/) and the docs site from Microsoft (http://docs.asp.net/projects/mvc/en/latest/views/tag-helpers/authoring.html).

The production code for this episode is ZX.
