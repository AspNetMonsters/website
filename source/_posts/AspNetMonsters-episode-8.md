There is a lot of newness in the default project in MVC Core, so we wanted to break it down and help make it feel a little more familiar. This is episode #8, and we're walking you through the "File -> New Project" experience.

Starting with the blank slate of the default application, Simon explores the project template and starts to map out what we should expect to see when we're getting started on a new project. 

You won't always start from the template, but gleaning what the ASP.NET team does can give insight into best practices and/or direction you can take to get your application on the right path.

The production code for this episode is IG.
