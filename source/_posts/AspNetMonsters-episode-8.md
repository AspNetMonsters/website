<p>There is a lot of newness in the default project in MVC Core, so we wanted to break it down and help make it feel a little more familiar. This is episode #8, and we're walking you through the &quot;File -&gt; New Project&quot; experience.</p><p>Starting with the blank slate of the default application, Simon explores the project template and starts to map out what we should expect to see when we're getting started on a new project. You won't always start from the template, but gleaning what the <a href="http://ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a> team does can give insight into best practices and/or direction you can take to get your application on the right path.</p><p>Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/AspNetMonsters">the Monsters on Twitter</a> and check out <a href="http://aspnetmonsters.com">the blog</a> for related posts.</p><p>The production code for this episode is Jz.</p> <img src="http://m.webtrends.com/dcs1wotjh10000w0irc493s0e_6x1g/njs.gif?dcssip=channel9.msdn.com&dcsuri=https://s.ch9.ms/Series/aspnetmonsters/feed&WT.dl=0&WT.entryid=Entry:RSSView:384d4e38d9bc4a1b97aca5ae0048e859">
