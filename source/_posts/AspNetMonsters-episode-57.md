<p>Entity Framework Core doesn't support lazy loading yet which means you need to explicitly tell Entity Framework what related data to include when querying for an entity. In today's episode, Monster Dave shows us how to load related data using the .Include and .ThenInclude extension methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p>
