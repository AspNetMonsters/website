<p>I can't remember if NodeJS is still cool or if people are only using it ironically now as they port their applications to something else. In either case there are still a lot of great node modules out there which it would be great to access from our ASP.NET application. In this episode we'll look at Node Services an approach to call out to Node from inside an ASP.NET MVC Core controller.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
