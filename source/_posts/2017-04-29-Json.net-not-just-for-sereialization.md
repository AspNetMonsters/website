If you happen to head over to [https://www.nuget.org/packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages) and look at which package has been downloaded the most there is a clear winner: JSON.net. It is in everything, every where. JSON is so wildly ubiquitous that I play a little game with myself when I start a new project: how long can I go before I need to serialize or deserialize JSON and need to pull in JSON.net. I rarely last more than a couple of hours.

But it turns out that there is a lot more that JSON.net can do.

My good buddy [Eric Fleming](https://ericflemingblog.wordpress.com/) found this one and I'm really just stealing it from him(although [James](http://jameschambers.com/) claims he found it). The problem that we were trying to solve was that we wanted to patch together a new JSON object out of a bunch of C# objects. It could have been done by building a new DTO, mapping a number of objects to it and then serializing it to JSON. This was kind of a lot of work. Static languages are nice but chucking together ad hoc objects isn't a strong suit. In this case we used JObject to structure the new object

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var sock = new Sock{
            Colour = "blue",
            Size = "medium"
        };
        var shoe = new Shoe{
            Material = "leather"
        };
        var ensemble = JObject.FromObject(sock);
        ensemble.Merge(JObject.FromObject(shoe));
        Console.WriteLine(ensemble.ToString());
    }
}

class Sock{
    public string Colour {get; set;}
    public string Size {get; set;}
}

class Shoe{
    public string Material{get; set;}
}

```

The output looks like

```json
{
  "Colour": "blue",
  "Size": "medium",
  "Material": "leather"
}
```

This approach can be useful in a number of scenarios

 - Treating an object as a mixin and applying it to a bunch of differently shaped JSON
 - Merging existing JSON with C# objects

The latter scenario can be achieved like so 

```csharp
var hatJObject = JObject.Parse(@"
                {
                    'HatSize': 'Large'
                }
            ");
var ensemble = JObject.FromObject(sock);
var shoeJObject = JObject.FromObject(shoe);
shoeJObject.Merge(JObject.FromObject(shoeLace));
ensemble.Merge(shoeJObject);
ensemble.Merge(hatJObject);
```

This outputs

```json
{
  "Colour": "blue",
  "Size": "medium",
  "Material": "leather",
  "LaceLength": 30,
  "HatSize": "Large"
}
```


There are also `JObject.Load` and `JObject.Read` for reading from JSON streams.

Newtonsoft.JSON is such a well known and well developed library that it is a shame to just use `JsonConvert` methods when there is such additional richness.
