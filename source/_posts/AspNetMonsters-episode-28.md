<p>Yes! You can accept payments in your ASP.NET Core applications. Third party payment processing systems have really come of age and made it not only simple for you to start collecting payments, but also help to keep your users' personal information - such as credit cards - private...and more importantly off your server.</p><p>In this episode, Monster James shows us how to create a system for accepting user information, creating subscriptions using the Stripe.net NuGet package&nbsp;and integrating all of that into our application. We'll use the Stripe.js library to negotiate a token representing the user's credit card data and never have to submit the sensitive bits&nbsp;to our server.</p><p>This episode will also make use of some other features we've previously covered:</p><ul><li><a title="User Secrets" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-23-Working-With-Sensitive-Data-User-Secrets" target="_blank">User Secrets</a></li><li><a title="Configuration Settings" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-5-Configuration-Settings" target="_blank">Configuration Settings</a></li><li><a title="The Options Pattern" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/aspnetmonsters/Episode-6-JSON-Data-and-The-Options-Pattern" target="_blank">The Options Pattern</a> (for strongly-typed configuration)</li></ul><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p>
