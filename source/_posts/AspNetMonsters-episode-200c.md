Over the last decade as Monsters we've been so fortunate to connect with so many great people in the industry. In this 5 part series leading up to episode 200 we reconnect with some of the visionaries, teachers, mentors and community members who have inspired us along the way.

In episode '200c' we get Andrew Stanton-Nurse on the line to talk about internships, the early days of Nuget and the MVC Framework as well as .NET Core. Once all long-out projects, Andrew had a front row seat on the teams that made those products real.

Today, Andrew is at GitHub, rewiring the innards to be more modular, experimenting behind the scenes and working to improve the code that serves and backs over 100 million projects worldwide.
