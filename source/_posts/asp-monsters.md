First there was ASP, then ASP.NET then everything changed in ASP.NET but we still, inexplicably, called it ASP.NET. 

The ASP.NET Monsters are here to explain everything they know about ASP.NET Core and MVC 6. Once or so per week Dave, James and Simon publish a new, short video about some aspect of ASP.net in their own, monstrous, style.

Meet The Monsters.

Simon Timms hates writing biographies. He would much rather be working on his current book, Evolving ASP.net Applications or encouraging people to read his previous two books. He would also like to be setting up more talks for the Calgary .net User Group where he acts as president and speaks several times a year. There is rumor that instead of writing bios in years gone by he has done development for various companies around Calgary and spent several years running a large build system. While writing this bio he was distracted by an e-mail from the ASP.net/IIS MVP mailing list where he is a first time member. He almost didn't get back to finishing this bio but he had to wait for a DNS update to blog.simontimms.com where he blogs semi-regularly.
