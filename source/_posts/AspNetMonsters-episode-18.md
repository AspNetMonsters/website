<p>Building and packaging is super fun with the new build framework in ASP.NET Core. &nbsp;In this episode we take a look at how to hook into the various different stages of the build. There is a bit more about the build hooks at&nbsp;http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/dnx/projects.html#scripts</p><p>Build hooks are entry points into the build pipeline that allow you to interact with the build system, assets in your project or artifacts that result from the build. These are a powerful tool for developers and can be used for a variety of scenarios.</p><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p>
