<p>In this episode of the Monsters we are joined by community expert Darrel Miller, and we talk about a wide variety of API development topics ranging from standards to best practices to doing things wrong (i.e., anything to do with versioning). We also have a pretty good chat about API Management in Azure (Darrel is on that team, making it better one byte at a time).</p><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/darrel_miller">Follow @darrel_miller</a></p><p><a class="twitter-follow-button" href="https://twitter.com/aspnetmonsters">Follow @aspnetmonsters</a></p>
