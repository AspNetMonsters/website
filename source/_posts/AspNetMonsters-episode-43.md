In today's episode, Mads Kristensen sets us straight on the new Bundler Minifier and the direction the ASP.NET team has decided to take in the default project template. Mads takes us through the Bundler Minifer, what it is capable of, how it differs from `System.WebOptimization` and Gulp, and most importantly why it exists in the first place.
