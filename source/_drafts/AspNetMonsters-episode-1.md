Well, here we go! This is the inaugural installment of The Monsters Weekly, where we take you up, down through and over all the aspects of ASP.NET Core and Core MVC. In our first espisode we're covering the `startup.cs` class and what happens as our application loads.

Not sure where to start in ASP.NET Core? Well, in `startup.cs`, of course. We run the file top-to bottom covering some basic configuration, dependency injection, browser link, database error pages, service configuration and the Julie Lerman of Canada.  This is an intro - we cover a lot of ground at 30,000 feet, but don't worry, we'll be breaking it down in the weeks ahead. 

The production code for this video is `VG`.
